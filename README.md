# Heap-Block

This repository implements a blockchain solution in python.
The solution is about allowing easier exchange of private or sensitive medical data on 
blockchain networks, with fine grain privacy management. Each patient could thus configure his medical file in such a 
way as to authorize access (total or partial) to the people of his choice 
(attending physician, family, statisticians, etc.)
